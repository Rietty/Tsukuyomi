# Tsukuyomi

Simply the storage unit of some plugins that I built to be either included in Dalamud/XIVLauncher, or to simply offer as a third party plugin. If you use the experimental URL below to install any plugins, please note that support for these versions is not offered and they are mostly meant for personal use.

Support is only offered on plugins actually in the XIVLauncher testing/main plugin branches, which are in their own repos.

Third party experimental URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tsukuyomi,/Lamentorum/main/pluginmaster.json`

## Plugin Listing (Testing/Official):
