# AutoMammet
Provides an easy copy and pastable CSV format you can use for island sanctuary spreadsheets. Provides options to export the popularity, future popularity and the current cycle's demand and shift values. Both as words and as numbers on a scale of -2 to 2. This plugin does not provide any calculations for Island Sanctuary, merely an export option for your ingame data. 

Can use the `/mammet` command to bring up the main window.

Usage is very straightforward, simply install/enable the plugin and then go to your island. Review your workshop supply and demand in order to load/grab the latest values on the information screen.

Make sure this matches in the plugin if you display the extracted table. You can then export the columns as desired. Make sure to check the second box if you would like the values to be their Text, else it will use numbers -2 to 2 instead.

Finally, after exporting simply go to Google Sheets or Excel and paste it there using the CSV option.
